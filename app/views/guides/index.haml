      %h1 Teambox Quick Guide
      %p Welcome to the Teambox Guide. This guide is meant to give you a way to get started with Teambox and an overview of how Teambox is structured so that you can get up and running quickly. If some thought is given at this stage to your Teambox organization structure it is helpful, though not necessary since many items can be changed later on. For this guide we will be using the basic free account which allows 3 projects.

    %h2#how-teambox-is-structured How Teambox is structured
    %div
      %p Teambox is comprised of the following primary elements: Projects, People, Tasks, Pages, Conversations and Files. Within these elements you can do several things such as assign People to Projects, assign start and end dates to Tasks, send notifications, etc.

    %h2#setting-preferences Setting your Teambox Preferences and Project Configuration
    %div
      %p Once you have signed up for Teambox, you will see the following screen inviting you to create your first project. However before clicking on Create Your First Project, let’s set your overall preferences and project configuration in Account Settings. As the initiator of your Teambox account, you are the owner. If you have been invited to join a project your participation will be governed by the role you were assigned when you were invited. Your role can be changed by the owner or an administrator. Click on "Settings" on the top right next to your user name.

      %p Click "update account" to finish.

    %h2#your-notifications Your Notifications

      %p Click "update account" to finish.

    %h2#organizations Organizations
    %div
      %p At the top level of how you can organize your Teambox, "Organizations" is the umbrella under which you can group your projects, tasks and participants. Think about the name you would like to give your organization. You do not need to create an Organization at this time to create your first Project, but as you move forward, your structure may benefit from creating an Organization.
      %p You can:
      %ul
        %li Customize your organization with your own login page and logo, and link it to your domain. Your unique, branded Teambox identity is perfect for collaborating with clients.
        %li
          Go to Organizations on the right-side navigation menu. click on "Organizations". A drop-down menu will appear, click on "Manage Organizations".
          = image_tag "/images/newguide/organizations.png"
        %li
          Now you can create your Organization, click on "Create a new Organization" and type in a name.
          = image_tag "/images/newguide/organizations-manage.png"
        %li Create the short code for your organization, this will be used for the web address and your notifications. It needs to be at least 4 letters, but keep it short.
      %p Click on "Save Changes".

      %p Now let’s create your first project.
    %h2#projects Projects
    %div
      %p Projects are a core element within Teambox and are where much of the action takes place. Within your projects you can:
      %ul
        %li Add people to projects and assign them roles to structure their operational ability.
        %li Assign Tasks to people.
        %li Create timelines for tasks.
        %li Upload project files.
        %li Post conversations.
        %li Create Pages where general project information is maintained and can be added to by all participants.
      %p Think about your organization’s structure to decide how your project could be grouped and assigned to people. You could have a separate project for sales, development, client projects, human resources, conference preparation, etc. Each project can have different people, tasks, timelines, project files, pages and conversations associated with it. People will only be able to see the activity for the projects they are invited to. They will not be able to view any activity for other projects within the Organization.
      %p Let’s create your first project.
      %ul
        %li
          Click on "Manage Projects" on the right-side navigation menu. Create your first project by clicking on "New Project".

          = image_tag "/images/newguide/organization-settings.png"

    %h2#people-and-permissions People and Permissions
    %div

      %p To reorder the sequence of Pages themselves:
      %ul
        %li Go to the right-hand navigation pane under All Pages.
        %li
          Click on the blue "Reorder"
          = image_tag "/images/newguide/reorder-pages.png"
        %li
          Use the arrow cross to reorder the sequence of the Pages by grabbing it and dragging up and down to position the Page
          = image_tag "/images/newguide/reorder-pages-done.png"
      %p Click the blue "Done" when you are finished.
    %h2#files Files
    %div
      %p The files section is a respository for all files uploaded anywhere in your Teambox. They will give you an overview and quick easy access to all files without having to search through different elements.
      %p Click on "Files" on the right-hand navigation menu to see all files.

    %h2#communications-between-teambox-members Communications between Teambox members
    %div
      %h3
        The @membername command
      %p Using the @membername command in the body copy of any element will automatically send an email to that member. For example while composing a Conversation you want to bring to the attention of teammate Sally Fisher, anywhere in the body copy type (without quotes) “@sallyfisher” and she will immediately receive an email.

      %h3
        Teambox and email
      %p You can use your email client to send emails to members, reply to and forward emails and create Conversations, Tasks and comments and have them sent directly to a Teambox element.
      %ul
        %li
          To reply to an email:
          %p Open the Teambox email you wish to reply to in your email client and select “Reply”. You will see "REPLY ABOVE THIS LINE TO POST AN ANSWER".
          %p Compose your text above this line, eliminate unnecessary text below and send. You can also insert an @membername in the body copy to have this email sent to a member not included in the header.
          %p To forward an email or create a Conversation, Task or comment from within your email client and have it sent to your Teambox, you will need the specific Teambox address associated with your account. When you initially created your Project a short identifier permalink was created for the Project. To locate it:
          %p For the Project permalink: on the right-hand navigation menu click on “Projects”, select the Project, then click on “Settings” then “General Settings”.
          %p For these examples we will use a sample project—Keiretsu which has the address: http://teambox.com/projects/keiretsu
          %p If your project name has more than one word it will have a hyphen between the words. If your project name is a common name and therefore the same as another Teambox project name it will have a number assigned to it. i.e. keiretsu-website-project-22, because it is such a common name.
        %li
          To forward an email, it is handled by creating a Conversation in your Project:
          %p Open the email you wish to forward in your email client and select “Forward”. In the “To” field put in your project permalink address. For example, keiretsu@app.teambox.com.
          %p This will create a Conversation posted to your Project. If you want to be sure to bring this Conversation to the immediate attention of all project members you can add in the “@all” command in the body copy above the forwarded content, or the “@membername” for individual members.

        %li To post a new Conversation from your email, open a new email and put the title of the Conversation as the subject line. Address it to keiretsu+conversation@app.teambox.com

        %li To post a comment to a Conversation you will need the conversation ID number. In this example the ID is 5. Address it to: keiretsu+conversation+5@app.teambox.com

        %li
          To create a Task.
          %p Open a new email and put the title of the Task as the subject line. Address it to: keiretsu+task@app.teambox.com

        %li To post a comment to a Task you will need the Task ID number. In this example the ID is 12. Address it to: keiretsu+task+12@app.teambox.com

        %li
          Change the status of a Task.
          %p When replying to a Teambox email you can use the following keywords to change the status of a Task. Add the following codes to the beginning of the email content area:
          %ul
            %li #username will asign the task to the member @membername.
            %li #resolve or #resolved will mark the task as resolved.
            %li #reject or #rejected will mark the task as rejected.
            %li #hold will set the task on hold.
